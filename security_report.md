# Security Report

## Vulnerability: Default SECRET_KEY

### Description
The Django application was using a default, insecure `SECRET_KEY`. This could allow attackers to compromise the application by forging signatures or decrypting sensitive data.

### Location
- File: `apps/api/api/settings.py`
- Line: 24

### Remediation
The `SECRET_KEY` was updated to use a securely generated random value using Python's `secrets.token_hex()` function. The application now attempts to retrieve the `SECRET_KEY` from the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` environment variable, falling back to a securely generated random value if the environment variable is not set.

### Status
Resolved. The application now uses a secure `SECRET_KEY`.
