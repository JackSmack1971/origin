# Test Plan: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enhancement

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhancement, as specified in the feature overview specification document located at [docs/specs/MFA_overview.md](docs/specs/MFA_overview.md). The primary goal of this test plan is to ensure the successful implementation of server-side validation for MFA codes and the removal of the hardcoded verification code, thereby improving the overall security of the MFA process.

## 2. Test Scope

The test scope includes all functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the feature specification, specifically focusing on:

*   Server-side validation of MFA codes.
*   Removal of the hardcoded verification code.
*   Secure generation and storage of MFA secrets.
*   Integration with the existing authentication flow.

The test scope excludes:

*   Support for other MFA methods (e.g., SMS, email).
*   Advanced security features (e.g., adaptive authentication).
*   UI/UX changes to the MFA setup or login screens.

## 3. Test Strategy

The test strategy will encompass a combination of black-box and white-box testing techniques. Black-box testing will focus on validating the functionality from the user's perspective, while white-box testing will examine the internal code structure and logic.

*   **Functional Testing:** Verify that the MFA process functions as expected, including server-side validation, secret generation, and code verification.
*   **Security Testing:** Assess the security of the MFA implementation, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
*   **Performance Testing:** Evaluate the performance of the server-side validation to ensure it does not introduce significant latency.
*   **Integration Testing:** Ensure seamless integration with the existing authentication flow.

## 4. Test Cases

### 4.1 Positive Test Cases

*   **TC001:** Verify that a user can successfully authenticate using MFA with a valid code.
*   **TC002:** Verify that the system generates and stores MFA secrets securely.
*   **TC003:** Verify that the enhanced MFA process integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication flow.

### 4.2 Negative Test Cases

*   **TC004:** Verify that the system rejects an invalid MFA code.
*   **TC005:** Verify that the system prevents access if the MFA code is not entered.
*   **TC006:** Verify that the system handles expired MFA codes correctly.

### 4.3 Boundary Value Test Cases

*   **TC007:** Test the system's response to MFA codes with lengths at the minimum and maximum allowed values.
*   **TC008:** Test the system's response to special characters or symbols in the MFA code (if applicable).

## 5. Test Data

The test data will include:

*   Valid user credentials.
*   Invalid user credentials.
*   Valid MFA codes.
*   Invalid MFA codes.
*   Expired MFA codes.

## 6. Test Environment

The test environment will consist of:

*   A development or staging environment that mirrors the production environment.
*   A database for storing MFA secrets.
*   A TOTP library for generating and verifying MFA codes.
*   Appropriate testing tools and frameworks.

## 7. Requirements Traceability

| Requirement ID | Test Case ID(s) |
|---|---|
| FR001 (Server-Side Validation) | TC001, TC004 |
| FR002 (Secret Generation) | TC002 |
| FR003 (Secure Storage) | TC002 |
| FR004 (Code Verification) | TC001, TC004, TC005, TC006 |
| FR005 (Integration) | TC003 |

## 8. Acceptance Test Planning

Acceptance testing will be performed by end-users or stakeholders to ensure that the enhanced MFA process meets their requirements and expectations. The acceptance criteria will be based on the user stories and acceptance criteria outlined in the feature specification.
