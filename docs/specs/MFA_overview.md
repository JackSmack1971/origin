# Feature Overview Specification: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enhancement

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the feature overview specification for enhancing the existing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation. The primary goals of this enhancement are to implement server-side validation for MFA codes and remove the hardcoded verification code to improve security.

## 2. Goals

*   Implement server-side validation of MFA codes.
*   Remove the hardcoded verification code.
*   Improve the overall security of the MFA process.

## 3. User Stories

*   As a user, I want the MFA code to be validated on the server-side so that the application is more secure.
*   As a developer, I want the hardcoded verification code to be removed so that the application is less vulnerable to attacks.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

*   The MFA code is validated against the server before granting access.
*   The hardcoded verification code is removed from the codebase.
*   The system generates and stores MFA secrets securely.
*   Users can successfully authenticate using MFA with the new server-side validation.
*   The enhanced MFA process is integrated seamlessly with the existing authentication flow.

## 5. Functional Requirements

*   **Server-Side Validation:** The system must validate the MFA code entered by the user against the server.
*   **Secret Generation:** The system must generate MFA secrets (e.g., using a time-based one-time password algorithm - TOTP).
*   **Secure Storage:** The generated secrets must be stored securely in the database.
*   **Code Verification:** The system must verify the user-provided MFA code against the stored secret.
*   **Integration:** The enhanced MFA process must integrate seamlessly with the existing authentication flow.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Security:** The MFA implementation must be secure and protect against common attacks.
*   **Performance:** The server-side validation should not introduce significant latency.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent MFA requests.
*   **Reliability:** The MFA process should be reliable and available.

## 7. Scope

### 7.1 In Scope

*   Implementation of server-side MFA code validation.
*   Removal of the hardcoded verification code.
*   Secure generation and storage of MFA secrets.
*   Integration with the existing authentication flow.
*   Testing and validation of the enhanced MFA process.

### 7.2 Out of Scope

*   Support for other MFA methods (e.g., SMS, email).
*   Advanced security features (e.g., adaptive authentication).
*   UI/UX changes to the MFA setup or login screens.

## 8. Dependencies

*   Existing authentication system.
*   Database for storing MFA secrets.
*   TOTP library for generating and verifying MFA codes.

## 9. UI/UX Considerations

*   No UI/UX changes are planned for this enhancement. The focus is on the server-side implementation.

## 10. API Design Notes

*   A new API endpoint may be required for validating the MFA code.
*   The API should be secured using appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
