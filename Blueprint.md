## Project Title: CreativeFoundry
## Prepared By: Bret Tousignant
## Date: May 11, 2025

## Section 1: The Big Picture - What is this program all about?

### 1. Elevator Pitch: If you had 30 seconds to describe your program to a friend, what would you say? What's the main goal?
   
   **Your Answer:** CreativeFoundry is your personal content creation studio that transforms a single idea into polished, professional content across multiple formats simultaneously. Instead of spending hours creating separate blog posts, social media content, emails, and videos, you enter your idea once and our AI generates all formats while maintaining your brand voice. It learns from your feedback and improves with every interaction, saving you 70% of your content creation time.

### 2. Problem Solver: What specific problem does this program solve, or what task does it make much easier or better?
   
   **Your Answer:** CreativeFoundry solves three critical challenges: 1) The "blank page problem" - the difficulty of starting content creation from scratch, 2) Maintaining brand voice consistency across multiple platforms, and 3) The limited resources most creators and businesses have to produce the volume of content required for modern digital marketing.

### 3. Why Does This Need to Exist? What's the key benefit it offers?
   
   **Your Answer:** CreativeFoundry dramatically reduces the time needed to produce high-quality content (by at least 70%) while ensuring 100% brand consistency across all content formats. It enables individuals and small teams to produce enterprise-level content volumes (at least 3x more) without hiring additional staff or sacrificing quality.

## Section 2: The Users - Who is this program for?

### 1. Primary Users: Describe the main type of person (or people) who will use this program.
   
   **Your Answer:** CreativeFoundry serves four primary user groups: 1) Marketing Professionals who need to create content across multiple channels while maintaining brand consistency, 2) Content Creators who face creative blocks and need to repurpose content efficiently, 3) Small Business Owners/Entrepreneurs with limited marketing resources who need professional-quality content, and 4) Freelancers who manage multiple client voices and need high output to maintain profitability.

### 2. User Goals: When someone uses your program, what are the top 1-3 things they want to accomplish with it?
   
   **Your Answer:**
   1. Generate professional-quality content in multiple formats (blog, social, email, video) from a single concept or brief
   2. Maintain consistent brand voice and messaging across all content formats
   3. Reduce time spent on content creation while increasing output volume and quality

## Section 3: The Features - What can the program do?

### 1. Core Actions: List the essential actions or tasks users can perform within the program.
   
   **Your Answer:**
   * Create and manage brand profiles with voice settings and brand assets
   * Generate complete content packages from a single brief
   * Edit and refine AI-generated content with version history
   * Save templates for recurring content needs
   * Schedule content for publication across platforms
   * Track content performance and get AI improvement suggestions
   * Collaborate with team members on content review
   * Export content in multiple file formats
   * Connect to social media, CMS, and email platforms
   * Train the AI on existing content to match established voice

### 2. Key Feature Deep Dive: Pick the MOST important feature from your list above.
   
   **Your Answer:** The Multi-Format Content Generation feature works like this: The user navigates to the "Create" section and selects "New Content Package." They enter a topic (e.g., "Spring Sale for Outdoor Furniture") and are presented with a guided brief form to specify target audience, key messages, tone, and any specific requirements. After submitting the brief, the system generates within 2 minutes: a detailed blog post, 5 social media posts with image suggestions, 3 email sequences (announcement, mid-sale, final day), and a short video script. All content maintains consistent messaging and brand voice. The user can then view, edit, and refine each piece individually, schedule for publication, or export the content. The brief can be saved as a template for future campaigns, and the system learns from edits to improve future generations.

## Section 4: The Information - What does it need to handle?

### 1. Information Needed: What kinds of information does the program need to work with, store, or display?
   
   **Your Answer:**
   * User account information (name, email, password, subscription level)
   * Brand profile data (name, industry, description, voice characteristics)
   * Brand assets (logos, colors, images, style guides)
   * Content briefs (topic, audience, purpose, key points, tone)
   * Generated content (all formats and versions)
   * Content templates (saved briefs and patterns)
   * Publication schedules (dates, times, platforms)
   * Platform connection credentials (APIs, tokens)
   * Performance analytics (engagement, clicks, views)
   * Team member information and permissions
   * User feedback and preference data

### 2. Data Relationships: Do any pieces of information naturally belong together?
   
   **Your Answer:** A User can have multiple Brand Profiles. Each Brand Profile contains Brand Assets, Voice Settings, and Templates. A Content Brief belongs to a Brand Profile and generates a Content Package. A Content Package contains multiple Content Items of different types (blog, social, email, video). Content Items can have multiple Versions as they're refined. A Publication Schedule includes multiple Content Items with specific dates/times for different platforms. Analytics data is associated with specific Content Items to track performance.

## Section 5: The Look & Feel - How should it generally seem?

### 1. Overall Style: Choose words that describe the general vibe.
   
   **Your Answer:** Professional & Clean with Creative Touches - sophisticated and streamlined interface with intuitive workflow that doesn't overwhelm users, but incorporates subtle creative elements that inspire without distracting.

### 2. Similar Programs (Appearance): Are there any existing websites or apps whose look you like?
   
   **Your Answer:** Notion's clean interface and block-based content editing, Canva's intuitive creation workflow and template selection, Grammarly's elegant feedback and suggestion system, and Airtable's organized viewing options for different content types.

## Section 6: The Platform - Where will it be used?

### 1. Primary Environment: Where do you imagine most people using this program?
   
   **Your Answer:** Primary Choice: On a Website (accessed through Chrome, Safari, etc.)
   Secondary Choices: As Computer Programs (installed on Windows and Mac)

### 2. (If Mobile App): Does it need to work without an internet connection sometimes?
   
   **Your Answer:** Not applicable for primary version, but desktop applications should have basic offline capabilities for content editing.

## Section 7: The Rules & Boundaries - What are the non-negotiables?

### 1. Must-Have Rules: Are there any critical rules the program must follow?
   
   **Your Answer:** User content and brand information must remain strictly confidential. Generated content must be unique and free of plagiarism. The system must provide multiple options/variations when requested. Users must have full editing capabilities over all AI-generated content. All content must comply with relevant advertising and content regulations. The system must respect user-set boundaries for content tone and style.

### 2. Things to Avoid: Is there anything the program should absolutely not do?
   
   **Your Answer:** Never publish content automatically without user review and approval. Don't use sensitive customer data for training without explicit permission. Don't create content that could be misleading, harmful, or discriminatory. Don't share user content briefs or generated content with other users. Don't create overly generic content that doesn't reflect brand voice settings.

## Section 8: Success Criteria - How do we know it's perfect?

### 1. Definition of Done: Describe 2-3 simple scenarios.
   
   **Your Answer:**
   1. When a user enters a brief for a "Summer Product Launch" campaign, the system generates a complete package including a blog post, social media content, and email copy within 2 minutes. All content maintains consistent messaging and brand voice while being appropriate for each platform's format requirements.
   
   2. When a user trains the system on existing content, it produces new content that team members can recognize as having their brand voice (verified by blind testing where 80% of team members correctly identify AI-generated content as matching their brand voice).
   
   3. When a user connects social media accounts and schedules generated content, it publishes according to the specified schedule with proper formatting, links, and media attachments across all platforms without requiring manual adjustments.
